      <description>On Endings This is Hyper-normalisation, a monthly newsletter by Tom Eldridge on Strategic Design and this is the final edition. My intent with this newsletter was to keep it limited to 12 editions. These will now be archived on my website and the mailing list deleted. The internet/metaverse has given us many good things. But it’s very bad at endings and there is nothing sadder than seeing something limp on.</description>

      <description>Refresh, Remake, and reverse Hello hypernormaliser reader
I&amp;rsquo;m writing this edition with storm Arwen roiling away in the background. As the studio is surrounded by woodland, it has the effect of sounding like the rolling waves crashing onto the beach.
 I built a new website. Over the years years I’ve been building websites to showcase my work. Squarespace was my go to web builder because it was simple to knock something fairly decent without any coding.</description>

      <description>Change, habits, and routine Hello hypernormaliser reader
In case you forgot, you subscribed to hypernormalisation a newsletter on strategic design by me, Tom Eldridge.
The autumn season feels more concrete now with reds and yellow leaf coverage popping out. If I was to summarise this past month for me it would be about change! Two cases of covid in my household threw my writing schedule out of kilter with some red-eye inducing early starts and long hours commuting by car.</description>

      <description>On Brian Eno&amp;rsquo;s Design Principles for city living Hello Reader
I realised that this newsletter can be hard to pin down. It zigs from cities, low carbon transportation, to systems, and to nature as a means of inspiration. Trying to wrangle these big themes into some sort of meaningful shape is tough. Tough in the sense that I&amp;rsquo;m constantly asking whether these topics hang together in a meaningful and engaging way?</description>

      <description>Designing services that are lighter and closer together Image: Adreas Levers - FlickR (Creative Commons) Hello Reader
This is a lighter edition than usual, due mainly to having taken some time off with my family this month. My first overseas trip in over 2 years and despite the extra safety steps it passed without incident. As soon as the aeroplane doors were pushed open, the warmth of the Spanish sun melted the past 18 months.</description>

      <description>Systems for writing, systems for building, systems for culture Hello Normaliser,
After weeks of endless rain, I am writing this month&amp;rsquo;s newsletter in the sun. As a reminder as we spin into the second half of 2021, this newsletter will end in December.
Behind the Hypernormal curtain, I&amp;rsquo;ve created a Rube Goldberg construction with each post hand-coded in Hugo. The writing system is involved, with each new post sent as a Buttondown newsletter and a version for archive on my website.</description>

      <description>Nature-based solutions; a new operating system for building urban resiliance to climate change Salut Normaliser,
How the heck have we crested into the second half of the year? Over lockdown, I’ve had some days that feel compressed, and other days that seem endless. I’m starting to think that my mind misses the change of scenery when commuting to the office. But then I remember I save 3 hours daily by not commuting</description>

      <description>Sky bridges to nowhere; why we need more subcultural infrastructures; and new operating systems for placemaking Hello Normalisers
A bee hive update. Since last month there has been little progress on my hive being inhabited. The previous owners left an operating manual and from what is written down, the hive seems to be in the right spot - sunny with a clear flight path for the bees. Sadly, the window for colonizing the space is closing with many bees having found alternative accommodation before the summer.</description>

      <description>Intro Greetings Readers
Green shoots and blossom are bloomin&#39; like crazy in my neck of the woods. It was a week before Christmas that my family and I moved into the new home. The trees were denuded and the garden was a mud bath. This month it is a welcome relief to see the garden start to come to life. As the days have got longer and warmer I stumbled on an item the previous owners had left behind.</description>

      <description>Creating new futures from chaos - lessons from Fukushima; the rise of small distributed platforms; and is designing for the individual part of the problem? Intro Hyper-Normalisers!
Hello, its me Tom
Spring is in the air and whisper it there is a feeling of hope that things are changing for the better.
I wonder how we will look back at the great pause 2020/21? One of the niggling thoughts I have had since the start of the year is whether things will be genuinely different or will we snap back to how things were?</description>

      <description>Designing for a future that&amp;rsquo;s a bit broken; what can we learn from indigenous technology; and the ambient sound of the future Intro Hello, subscribers to HyperNormalisation. A monthly newsletter that&amp;rsquo;s crypticaly about design and its capacity to create change. Your newsletter-er guide Tom here!
This 2nd edition has been fuelled by strong coffee and thin winter sun. February was all about snow in the UK. We had a big dollop of the good stuff that took me back to being a kid.</description>

      <description>Google really wants to build a city of the future; why 80&amp;rsquo;s pop group Aha were strategic designers; and the challenge of a solution looking for a problem Hello reader. Yes, you! Slushy and cold footed Tom here!
This 1st edition is brought to you on a wet and cold lockdown January day. The light dusting of snow this morning has turned to a cold mizzle. This is 1 of 12 issues I’ve promised to publish in 2021 on a rag-tag range of topics that are loosely connected to the idea of design making space to change things.</description>
