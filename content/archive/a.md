this is a.md

There is a single page with an image.

I wonder If I can duplicate the same image

1. First ordered list item
2. Another item

⋅⋅* Unordered sub-list. 

1. Actual numbers don't matter, just that it's a number

⋅⋅1. Ordered sub-list

4. And another item.

⋅⋅⋅You can have properly indented paragraphs within list items. Notice the blank line above, and the leading spaces (at least one, but we'll use three here to also align the raw Markdown).

⋅⋅⋅To have a line break without a paragraph, you will need to use two trailing spaces.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅Note that this line is separate, but within the same paragraph.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅(This is contrary to the typical GFM line break behaviour, where trailing spaces are not required.)

* Unordered list can use asterisks
- Or minuses
+ Or pluses

### About me

Hello, curious traveller to this bio. I am Tom Eldridge, a design strategist helping to build businesses, product and services that are sustainable and people orientated.
​​
### What is strategic design and where do I fit in? 
​​
I help organisations find the right opportunities to future-proof their business by helping them better integrate with the people and environments they operate in. Strategic Design builds on my background in service design, user research to create a more considered approach to services.

Here's a summary of the [**services I offer.**](/about/what-i-do/)

Through a strategic design process to solve problems, I accelerate learning and create more meaning for businesses, government bodies and their end-users. My approach to strategic design is based on the guideing principles of user research, identifying opportunities, and the crafting of resilient solutions. 
​​

But what **is** Strategic Design? I've written some thoughts on the discipline over **[here](https://www.strategyxdesign.co.uk/post/what-is-strategic-design)**

### Background
​
I studied Political Science at the London School of Economics. These brought two schools of thought crashing together - Systems Thinking and Strategic Policy - that heavily influences my ways of working today. That is taking a holistic view of a situation and developing a deeper understanding of people and their interaction with systems.
​
### Beyond talking about work what else do you do?
​
I am a runner and a triathlete who fell into these activities late in life.


My life is powered by good coffee rituals (the inverted aero press method if you must know is my preferred brewing technique) and the patience of my family and friends.
