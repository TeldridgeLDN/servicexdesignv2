### Google really wants to build a city of the future; why 80's pop group Aha were strategic designers; and the challenge of a solution looking for a problem

###Intro

Hello subscribers to Hyper-normalisation. A montlhy newsletter that's crypticaly about design and its capacity to create change. Your newsletter-er guide [Tom](/about/what-i-do/) here!

This 2nd of 12 editions has been fuelled by coffee and a thin winter sun. February was all about snow in the UK. We had a big dollup of the good stuff that took me back to being a kid. My kids were overjoyed at making their first ever snowman after being on this planet for 10 and 13 years. Impossible to predict if it will be their last. 


 Things they don‚Äôt tell you when moving out of the city: People like to burn things. In my new neighbourhood wood is the fuel of choice for heating the home, with the local forester making a brisk trade in selling logs felled from the local wood.  (Image of woods).

(Designing a future thats broken)
But will there be a place for log fires in the near future? The future aesthetic is a lazy trope of clutter free life, touch screens, hard vehicular blobs and 3D visualisations (images). It‚Äôs so clean, hard and glassy. Maybe just having screens showing UHD log fires will be enough. @fosta presents a compelling need to design for a future grounded in the mundane. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h12AkAIHyQw). From taking the rubbish out to doing the dishes our lives are 99.9% made up of these moments. It follows that designing for the future, should fold in this inherent mundane-ness of our lives. The future is likely to be a bit broken https://youtu.be/h12AkAIHyQw?t=929, and made of accretive layers https://youtu.be/h12AkAIHyQw?t=841. 

(A House for All Seasons)
Continuing the theme of the mundane, what if buildings were ambiently heated? A recent episode of Grand Designs showed a residential home designed so that the very structure and foundations acted as a storage battery. The house absorbs heat in the warmer months of the year and then slowly releases it back into the home in the colder months. With 40% of the UK greenhouse emissions being caused by the built environment https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/aug/31/architecture-to-counteract-climate-change-ilford-market-cork-house-barangaroo-mycelium the question is do we really know if a building is green enough based on current policy and measures of green-ness? 

 Where have the materials to build a house come from and how much energy was used in their creation will become increasingly important. 
‚ÄúThe British building regulations, for example, set reasonably high standards for the performance of buildings, but are silent on embodied energy.‚Äù (Guardian Quote?)  
 
 Low carbon and indigenous techniques offer a broader pallet with which to design and build our homes in the future.
 ‚ÄúFor architecture this might mean learning from indigenous building techniques based on using renewable materials close at hand, such as mud walls or thatch, enhanced with modern technology‚Ä¶making bricks out of mud, wall panels made of hemp and lime, materials made from compressed recycled denim or from ground-up pine needles mixed with pine resin. There is a technique for building columns by filling heavy duty fabric with sand or rubble. There is mycelium, a form of fungus that can be made into bricks.‚Äù
  
In the West, buildings are designed to keep the outside and inside separated and wage a constant battle to keep the right balance of light, airflow and temperature inside buildings. Whereas in the East there is a less of a separation between outside and in, the idea of a house for all seasons. Here, houses are designed with hot humid summers and cold winters in mind by letting air circulate easily and zoning ‚Äòliving‚Äô rooms in the winter when it is cold. https://www.designboom.com/architecture/takeru-shoji-architects-m-house-japan-06-06-2019/

(Cathedral Building)

In architecture, the term ‚ÄòCathedral Building‚Äô describes a much longer time horizon for a building to be finished -    

For countries to meet their commitment to averting the world‚Äôs current ark towards extinction will require central and local government backed solutions for designing and building low carbon homes that are accessible to the masses.  ‚ÄúSustainable design shouldn‚Äôt be seen as just a technical fix, a matter of paying the right consultant enough money to make sure the building ticks enough boxes, or of buying the most magical available piece of cooling technology. It should rather be integrated into the art of architecture.‚Äù  (Guardian quote?)
 
It will require a shift both in mindset and in policy to get housing developers to switch from short term thinking / profiteering and embrace a longer term horizon for returns. In the UK it will mean over-turning generations of thinking around home ownership and the stigma of social housing. (Poor doors) 

The Gordian knot of developers crying that they can‚Äôt afford to integrate low carbon techniques can be unpicked. Prototyping and experimentation offer a means to create compelling evidence that there is another way, opening up a lattice of fiscal and policy opportunities. https://blog.wearefuturegov.com/introducing-green-energy-systems-locally-c2a1b402ed5 .

From the future mundane to the present. I really enjoyed this train station on the banks of the Nishiki River in the Yamguchi Prefecture https://www.spoon-tamago.com/2019/03/24/seiryu-miharashi-station/ - It has no entrances or exit routes and the sole reason trains stop there is to offer its passengers the chance to enjoy the view over the river. To some this station seems like a modern day folly, all form over function. Yet there is something to be said for a train operator to encourage its passengers to enjoy the moment, and to offer contemplative break from modern life. 

Have you seen the proposal for Amazon HQ? It looks very green and it feels like it is a step in the right direction but details are lacking details as to how embedded into its environment it will actually be. It will be interesting to see if this becomes another Sidewalk Labs horror show https://www.dezeen.com/2021/02/03/amazon-hq2-headquarters-nbbj-glass-tower-usa/

More excitingly this 29 storey timber skyscraper in Berlin promises to offer not just affordable housing but space set aside for public uses such as a nursery and after-school clubs.  https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-11/berlin-has-high-hopes-for-this-wooden-skyscraper?cmpid=BBD021121_CITYLAB&utm_medium=email&utm_source=newsletter&utm_term=210211&utm_campaign=citylabdaily Contrast this approach with private development schemes in the UK and NYC where buildings have become gilded cages. In a  case of life imitating art J.G Ballard‚Äôs High Rise comes to mind with the super rich living in 432 Park Avenue https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2021/feb/07/supertall-skyscraper-new-york-432-park-avenue-rich

These snow google look ahead of their time, like something out of a sci-fi movie (Judowski‚Äôs Dune). Carved from strips of bone and wood by the indigenous people of Alaska they are 130 + years old and stunning.
