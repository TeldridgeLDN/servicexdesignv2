Greetings Readers 

Green shoots and blossom are bloomin' like crazy in my neck of the woods. It was a week before Christmas that we moved into the new home. The trees were de-nuded and the garden was a mud bath. This month is a welcome relief to see the garden start to come to life. As the days have got longer and warmer I stumbled on an item the previous owners had left behind. An empty beehive. This tipped me into YouTube loop of figuring out how to start it up. Turns out you need some bee 'lure' to get the scout bees interested. It's the equivalent of a high rating in AirBNB apparently. (Dr Evil Quotation) 

The plan is that by having a working hive, the garden will be healthier and create a sustainable habitat for the bees. Changing my garden's ecosystem with just a few phials of bee lure isn't going to be easy or quick so I'm playing the long game. 

### Music Culture & Spotify

This New York Times on [how our digitised world is beginning to shape pop music](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/03/14/opinion/pop-music-songwriting.html?campaign_id=51&emc=edit_mbe_20210319&instance_id=28222&nl=morning-briefing%3A-europe-edition&regi_id=94095106&segment_id=53737&te=1&user_id=e106be87beb01a9ff2941f0dc558cee5) is fascinating. To think that the contours of pop songs are now shaped by how we consume them today, shows the power of Spotify and Apple Music to alter culture in general. Sure, pop music has always been highly changeable, but since 2010 pop music has become less ridgid and less predictable. Many artists get to the hook of a song faster so the listener will hit the 30 seconds generally required for the streaming payment to register and then deliver a variety of catchy sections — rather than one repeating chorus — to keep people listening. Streaming has also incentivised writers to make pop songs shorter, in part because people can easily skip around.
