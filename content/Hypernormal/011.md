### Refresh, Remake, and reverse

Hello hypernormaliser reader

I'm writing this edition with storm Arwen roiling away in the background. As my home is surrounded by woodland,  it has the effect of sounding tlike the rolling waves crashing onto the beach.

### I built a new website.

Over the years years I’ve been building websites to showcase my work. Squarespace was my go to web builder because it was simple to knock something fairly decent without any coding. The downside to Squarespace is that under the hood is a heap of strung out lines of codes that hogs bandwidth and memory. In essence it lacks elegance. 

Last year over lockdown I learnt some rudimentary coding and levelled up by building a website using Hugo to replace Squarespace. (See screenshot of old website). My aim was to create a more responsive website that was efficient, light, and nice to look. 

Truth be told, I was never entirely happy with the end result and this says a lot more about my skills as a programmer to bridge what I wanted to create and what I ended up. I would give it a solid B grade. 

So onto Tom’s website 3.0 and this time I’ve kept things simple using HTML and CSS. I’m pleased with the results as the webpage [feels lighter and less cluttered.](https://www.strategyxdesign.co.uk/work) What’s more, it took barely a few hours to throw together.

### Accidental DAO 

I bought the Eldridge.Eth domain earlier this year and was gifted an airdrop of tokens that granted me membership of a DAO. DAO stands for distributed autonomous organisation and are designing new ways for people to come together and collaborate in a transparent and trustworthy way. Being decentralised, decisions are agreed by members and signed by way of digital smart contracts.

With crypto acting as the backbone, DAO’s can quickly build a treasury and get their members to vote on how best to use the funds. What’s crazy, is that the founders of [Juicebox DAO](https://juicebox.money/#/) were able to raise US$40million from their members in a single week to fund the bidding. At the time of writing this, Juicebox DAO narrowly missed out on buying a rare copy of the [US Constitution.](https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/18/constitutiondaos-bold-crypto-bid-for-us-constitution-falls-short/?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAMLFgGYztQieMpaBpEJBLPQjDlfOvMOsOgubszPmGh6Zf5jXraFJ0f_hfVxgSg-nzT0OdtLafKxTW-CkE4lcgRGPI0L58yu2P8wXDfXhDl1KVMVaz2pM7-8WcCF7klHnQcHLUU1veEiAVZZtLPXZIIWpZDkoTzzem5E6V7LD9Eod)

For all the goofiness in trying to buy the constitution or organising a pizza party in [60 countries](https://www.rarepizzas.com/), this decentralised form of collective action seems to have caught people’s imagination. The scaleability of DAO’s opens up the possibility for, towns or cities to adopt this model of governance and a proof of concept is being undertaken with https://www.citydao.io/ 

Another example is treeDAO: “The TreeDAO is a Distributed Autonomous Organization that Raises Funds, Buys Woodlands, and Sells NFTs representing partial ownership of the woodland. These NFTs are ideal gifts, durable, digital and unique. They will compete with gifts such as “Name a Star registry” and “adopt a zoo animal”. 

The funds have been raised and a woodland purchased with the view that ‘investors’ will be given a tree token which can be exchanged for a Non Fungible Token (NFT) and sold for a profit. I’m not entirely sold on the NFT angle because at this moment NFT’s have a whiff of Tulip Mania around them. That said, the same criticism was levelled at Crypto, and Bitcoin is over a decade old. However the fact that a group of like minded people can come together, pool resources and accelerate a cause opens up some exciting prospects for the future.

### Cycling speed

Hip electric bicycle makers VanMoof launched [a new electric bicycle](https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/12/vanmoof-teases-new-high-speed-electric-bike/?guccounter=1) that can hit up to 30mph. 

The big dilemma is by encouraging speed, are we neglecting the other benefits associated with cycling. The feeling of being more connected with the environment and people around you. Does this not melt away the more you increase the speed? By throttling up, is this not aping the behaviour of motorist in pushing speed over everything else? Or is it the rigid and backward looking policies that govern our roads that’s the problem?

Founder Ties Carlier said during the launch “In our vision, current policy is limiting the adoption of this type of transportation. We’re calling for policies designed for people instead of cars. That’s why we will work with city governments to explore geofencing and push for modernized speed regulations.”
 
What it brings into sharp focus is for policy to keep up with new and different ways with which to move around that doesn’t involve a combustion engine. But also questions around storage and security. These are no simple fixes as it involves consultation with all road users, as well as changing the street infrastructure of cities to accommodate these lighter forms of transport. Ensuring that users of city streets feel safe with sharing the space with these EV’s.

### Miscellany

[The clearest explanation of Web3.0](https://www.psl.com/feed-posts/web3-engineer-take) you will find today, stripped of hyperbole and techno jargon. 

I’ve been a paid up member of [Craig Mod’s newsletters](https://craigmod.com/) for over 3 years. Currently, Craig is writing an off-beat diary of Japan’s forgotten cities and the people he encounters. What I love about Craig’s writing is it opens a window to a world that is recognisably mundane but also so different to my (western) world view. Apart from having a distinct voice, what’s equally remarkable is that Craig has bootstrapped his own writing and publishing model. 

An archetype worth following who is doing something unique and forging his way of creating a sustainable business.



![Autumn 2021](/img/mushrooms.jpg)

The autumn season feels more concrete now with reds and yellow leaf coverage popping out. If I was to summarise this past month for me it would be about change! Two cases of covid in my household threw my writing schedule out of kilter with some red-eye inducing early starts and long hours commuting by car. My daily routines have suffered and it has been really hard to get back into the groove of writing.

### Car-centricity

It is not lost on me that part of the reason for my move out of London was to design a more sustainable way of living. But I have been feeling like the world’s biggest hypocrite sitting in traffic and filling my car with petrol in the middle of fuel crisis. Daily eighty mile commutes REALLY are energy-sapping. Motion sickness an unwelcomed and persistant ailment I never knew I had.


What has made me open my eyes is just how sticky car dependency is in the UK. I’m 10 minutes walk away from a suburban neighbourhood where front gardens have been paved over to accommodate cars. The cars spill over onto the streets with consideration for pedestrians an afterthought. 

I find it maddening and it has made me question just how sustainable suburban/rural life can be compared with city living?

### Cultural Capital

![Battersea Power Station 2021](/img/battersea_power_station.jpg)

This month has seen me venture back into Central London and back into the office. The overground trains feel luxurious with space and seats available even when jumping on close to the centre. Most commuters are masked up and respectful, with the occasional exception. On my commute, I passed by a rather sorry looking Battersea Power station. It feels like an opportunity has been wasted to turn that huge site into something truly special. Instead, developers have pulled the trick of making the original building, at one point the largest brick building in Europe, feel diminished.

It’s the very British disease that a development HAS to have private development if it to be greenlit. It doesn’t have to be this way. The Sara Cultural Centre in Sweden shows the value in building something that has cultural and civic value, which in turn brings economic value. This is the complete opposite to what Battersea Power Station offers with its private gyms and pools for the few not the many.

### Visual Systems

This month I’ve been thinking about different types of systems and weaving it into my daily practice as a strategic designer. Earlier this month I received my copy of Flexible Visual Systems by Martin Lorenz. It lays out how to design visual identities BUT it’s about systematically crafting an approach to design. There are some solid commonalities between this book and strategic design.

### Miscellany

Craig Mod has crafted a lovely video on his bookmaking journey Kissa by Kissa. Disclaimer I bought the 1st edition last year but to see the attention he’s put in subsequent editions is mind-blowing  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4u5_UyQoyw

NYTimes has an interesting take on how the demand for Vinyl has led to its own supply chain issues. It’s crazy how a now much smaller vinyl industry has accidentally created the conditions for people wanting more https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/21/arts/music/vinyl-records-delays.html


COP26 is on the horizon and in the UK there is the very real prospect of energy poverty this coming winter. FutureGov explores how we can transition to a low energy carbon system https://blog.wearefuturegov.com/understanding-the-need-for-low-carbon-energy-systems-in-uk-homes-bd810096db81
